# Overview


An application outlining the story of a cat named Carl.

This application is pretty simple. It's kind of like a choose your own adventure without any choices. The first screen has some story and you can click the button to see the next bit of story on the second screen. The button on the second screen takes you to the first.


I wanted to stretch my legs with Android application development. I've made applcations in Unity before, but Unity wouldn't be as good of a tool for developing an app for a company. (Walmart, Target, Subway, SRP, ect)

# Development Environment

Android Studio

* Java was the main language used.

# Future Work

* Add more screens
* Learn more about Navigation graph to open up the pathing between screens.
* Change colors of screens to make the application more unique
